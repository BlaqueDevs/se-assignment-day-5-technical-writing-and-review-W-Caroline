- **Comparison tables** help clarify differences between concepts.


## 8. What types of visuals (e.g., diagrams, charts) are most effective for different kinds of technical information?
- **Flowcharts** – Show processes and decision-making steps.
- **Diagrams** – Illustrate system architecture and relationships.
- **Screenshots** – Guide users through software interfaces.
- **Infographics** – Summarize complex data visually.
- **Tables** – Compare features, specifications, or versions.


## 9. How do headings and subheadings improve the readability and organization of technical documents?
- Help users **quickly locate** relevant information.
